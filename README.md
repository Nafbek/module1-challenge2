# <Week One Code Refactor Challenge II>

## Description

This project is a requirement for a web development bootcamp course and aims at refactoring the starter code as part of a coding project challenge. In essence, it has improved the structure of the codebase by regrouping elements, using semantic HTML elements, adding clickable main content, and introducing comments for clarity. In addition, the project strictly adheres to a specific user story and acceptance criteria. The border-radious has been applied to the sidebar to get it stand out differently.

### User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

###  Acceptance Criteria (It is a given)

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order.
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
